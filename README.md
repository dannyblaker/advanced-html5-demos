## Why haven't I included WebGL...

There are already so many good examples of WebGL out there that including a handful here wouldn't do WebGL justice. When working with 3D browser requirements, personally I go to libraries like Three.js which provides a simplified, higher-level API on top of WebGL, making it easier to create 3D scenes, handle rendering, and manage lighting and cameras without needing to write low-level WebGL code.
